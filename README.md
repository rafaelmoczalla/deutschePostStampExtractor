Create Date: 26 November 2021

Last Update: 26 December 2021

Tested with Python in version 3.9.7 on Ubuntu 21.10.

## Usage
The script requires Python version 3.6.0 or higher. Move the downloaded PDF from [shop.deutschepost.de](shop.deutschepost.de) to the script folder and rename it to `Briefmarke.pdf` The script generates PDF files with name convention `qr<i-th>.pdf` in the same folder. The script was tested with regular stamps. Stamps with additional services like "Einschreiben" may be the limitation of the script.
